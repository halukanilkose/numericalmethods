A fuel element of a nuclear reactor is in the shape of a plane wall of thickness 2L=20mm and is convectively cooled at both surfaces, 
with h=1100 W/m<sup>2</sup> K and T 250°C. At normal operating power, heat is generated uniformly within the element at a volumetric 
rate of 10<sup>7</sup>W/m<sup>3</sup>. A departure from the steady-state conditions associated with normal operation will occur if 
there is a change in the generation rate. Consider a sudden change to 2x10<sup>7</sup>W/m<sup>3</sup>, and use the explicit finite-difference 
method to determine the fuel element temperature distribution after 1.5s. The fuel element thermal properties are k=30 W/mK and alpha=5x10<sup>-6</sup>m<sup>2</sup>/s.
